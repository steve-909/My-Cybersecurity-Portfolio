My Cybersecurity Portfolio ‚Äì Where I'm Starting From
After completing my cybersecurity analyst training on Coursera, I realized something important: while I gained a lot of knowledge, I didn‚Äôt really have anything to show for it yet. No hands-on projects, no portfolio‚Äîjust a certificate. So now, I‚Äôm working on building a portfolio that actually reflects what I can do and how I think when it comes to solving real-world security problems.
How I‚Äôm Building My Portfolio ‚Äì Step by Step
1. Documenting My Learning Process
Instead of trying to look like I know everything, I want to show how I learn, how I approach problems, and how I grow. I'm planning to write short summaries of what I learn, maybe even blog-style breakdowns of tools or news stories I find interesting.

2. Hands-On Projects I‚Äôm Working On
Here are a few things I‚Äôve got in mind (some I‚Äôve already started):

SIEM Walkthrough (Splunk or Elastic Stack): I‚Äôm setting up a small lab where I can simulate basic attacks (like brute-force logins) and use a SIEM tool to investigate what happened. I‚Äôll take screenshots, break down my thought process, and write it up like an incident report.

Log Analysis with Python: I want to write a simple script that reads log files and flags weird activity‚Äîjust to practice spotting things like failed logins or suspicious IPs.

Threat Modeling for a ‚ÄúFake Company‚Äù: I‚Äôm going to create a fictional business (like a small e-commerce site), and then do a risk assessment on it‚Äîidentify threats, vulnerabilities, and propose ways to reduce the risks.

Vulnerability Scan Practice: Using tools like OpenVAS or Nessus on a VM, I‚Äôll run scans and then break down what the results mean in plain English‚Äîmaybe even turn that into a short report, like I‚Äôd give to a client.

Phishing Email Breakdown: I‚Äôm collecting examples of phishing emails and practicing how to analyze them‚Äîlooking at headers, links, and tactics used. I might turn that into a mini guide.

3. Sharing It All on GitHub
Instead of waiting until everything is ‚Äúperfect,‚Äù I‚Äôm uploading things as I go. Each project will have:

A clear write-up of what I did

Screenshots or code where it makes sense

Notes on what I‚Äôd do differently next time

4. Eventually... Maybe a Simple Website
Once I‚Äôve got a few things up, I‚Äôll probably create a small website‚Äînothing fancy‚Äîjust something that ties all the projects together and gives people a quick snapshot of what I‚Äôve done.

üß† Why I‚Äôm Doing This
I don‚Äôt just want to say I know cybersecurity‚ÄîI want to show how I think, how I work through problems, and how much I care about this field. Even if I‚Äôm still early in my journey, I believe the way I approach things can speak louder than any certificate.


I am a recent graduate with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems.

## Objective
